# VHS Coffeeman Project Status

## Project Overview

VHS Coffeeman is an interactive art installation that dispenses cocktails through a modified VHS player. When a participant inserts a VHS tape with an embedded RFID tag, the system plays curated film clips while mixing a drink through a series of peristaltic pumps.

## Migration Status

We are migrating the project from an RP2040 microcontroller to a Raspberry Pi platform. This document tracks the current state of the port and outlines what remains to be completed.

### Current Architecture

**Original System (RP2040):**
- VCR housing contains an RFID reader, RP2040 microcontroller, and ATmega328 running GRBL
- VHS tapes have RFID tags that trigger hardcoded drink recipes
- System controls up to 10 peristaltic pumps driven by stepper motors
- The RP2040 automatically controls the VCR's play and eject buttons through optoisolators

**New System (Raspberry Pi):**
- Raspberry Pi handles all functionality (GPIO, RFID reading, recipe storage, video playback)
- Communicates directly with GRBL controller for stepper motor control
- Stores drink recipes in JSON format for easy editing
- Plays curated film clips that match each VHS tape's theme
- Controls the VCR's physical buttons via GPIO
