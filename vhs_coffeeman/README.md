# VHS Coffeeman

An interactive art installation that dispenses cocktails through a modified VHS player.

## Overview

When a participant inserts a VHS tape with an embedded RFID tag, the system plays curated film clips while mixing a drink through a series of peristaltic pumps. The entire experience is designed to transform the familiar ritual of playing a VHS tape into a cocktail-making performance.
